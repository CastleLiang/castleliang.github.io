Dr. Yuxuan Liang is currently an Assistant Professor at [Intelligent Transportation Thrust](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/systems-hub/intelligent-transportation/), also affiliated with [Data Science and Analytics Thrust](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/information-hub/data-science-and-analytics/), [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/). He is working on the research, development, and innovation of spatio-temporal data mining and AI, with a broad range of applications in smart cities. Prior to that, he obtained his PhD degree at School of Computing, National University of Singapore, supervised by Prof. [Roger Zimmermann](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/rogerz) and Prof. [David S. Rosenblum](https://cs.gmu.edu/~dsr/). He also worked closely with Dr. [Yu Zheng](http://urban-computing.com/yuzheng) and Dr. [Junbo Zhang](https://zhangjunbo.org/) from JD Technology. He published 40+ papers in refereed journals (e.g., AI, TKDE) and conferences (such as KDD, NeurIPS, ICLR, WWW, ECCV, IJCAI, AAAI, and MM). His publications collectively gathered 2,300+ citations on Google Scholar, with h-index of 22 and i10-index of 33. Among them, three papers ([GeoMAN](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2018/0476.pdf), [ST-MetaNet](http://urban-computing.com/pdf/kdd_2019_camera_ready_ST_MetaNet.pdf) and [STMTMVL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ijcai16-Zheng-water-quality.pdf)) were selected as the most influential IJCAI/KDD papers according to PaperDigest, which indicates their significant impacts on both industry and academia. He also served as a PC member (or reviewer) for some prestigious conferences, including KDD, ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, WWW, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, IJCAI, AAAI, SIGSPATIAL, and Ubicomp. 

He was recognized as 1 out of 10 most innovative and impactful PhD students focusing on Data Science in Singapore by Singapore Data Science Consortium (SDSC) in 2020. His research interests mainly lie in
- **Spatio-temporal (ST) data mining**: ST representation learning, time series, ST imputation, AI for social good (e.g., transportation, human mobility, environment, climate), physics-informed learning.
- **Graph mining**: learning graph representations (e.g., directed graphs, temporal graphs), GNN pruning.
- **Computer vision**: video understanding, image recognition, image/video super-resolution.
