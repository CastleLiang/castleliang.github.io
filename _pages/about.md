Dr. Yuxuan Liang is currently an Assistant Professor at [Intelligent Transportation Thrust](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/systems-hub/intelligent-transportation/), also affiliated with [Data Science and Analytics Thrust](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/information-hub/data-science-and-analytics/), [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/). He is working on the research, development, and innovation of spatio-temporal data mining and AI, with a broad range of applications in smart cities. Prior to that, he obtained his PhD degree at School of Computing, National University of Singapore, supervised by Prof. [Roger Zimmermann](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/rogerz) and Prof. [David S. Rosenblum](https://cs.gmu.edu/~dsr/). He also worked closely with Dr. [Yu Zheng](http://urban-computing.com/yuzheng) and Dr. [Junbo Zhang](https://zhangjunbo.org/) from JD Technology. He published 100+ papers in refereed journals (e.g., TPAMI, AI, TKDE, TMC, IJGIS) and conferences (such as KDD, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, WWW, ECCV, IJCAI, AAAI, and MM). His publications collectively gathered 9,400+ citations on Google Scholar, with h-index of 48. Among them, six papers ([UrbanCLIP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.18340), [UniTime](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09751), [MixupGNN](https://bhooi.github.io/papers/mixup_web21.pdf), [GeoMAN](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2018/0476.pdf), [ST-MetaNet](http://urban-computing.com/pdf/kdd_2019_camera_ready_ST_MetaNet.pdf) and [STMTMVL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ijcai16-Zheng-water-quality.pdf)) were selected as the most influential papers according to PaperDigest, which indicates their significant impacts on both industry and academia. He has served as the Assosiate Editor of Neurocomputing (IF=6.0), and Area Chair/Senior PC for prestigious conferences, including KDD, NeurIPS, IJCAI and ICASSP. 

Based on his contributions to spatio-temporal data mining and urban computing, he was recognized as [Stanford/Elsevier Top 2% Scientists](https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/7) in 2024. He was recognized as 1 out of 10 most innovative and impactful PhD students focusing on Data Science in Singapore by Singapore Data Science Consortium (SDSC) in 2020. He has received several awards both domestically and internationally, including SDSC Dissertation Research Fellowship, the 23rd China Patent Excellence Award, and the ACM SIGSPATIAL China Chapter Rising Star Nomination Award. He is currently leading projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), Guangdong Province General Projects, CCF Tencent Rhino-Bird Fund, and CCF Didi Gaia Fund, among others.

His research interests mainly lie in
- **Spatio-temporal (ST) data mining**: ST foundation models, Urban/ST + LLMs, AI for social good (e.g., urban, transportation, human mobility, environment, climate), physics-informed learning.
- **Urban computing**: urban data sensing, urban data management, urban data analytics, urban decision-making.
- **Time series analysis**: foundation models, forecasting, imputation, decomposition, anomaly detection.
- **Multimodal learning**: urban multimodal fusion, vision-language pre-training, geo-localization.
