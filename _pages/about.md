Dr. Yuxuan Liang is currently an Assistant Professor at [Intelligent Transportation Thrust](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/systems-hub/intelligent-transportation/), also affiliated with [Data Science and Analytics Thrust](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/information-hub/data-science-and-analytics/), [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/). He is working on the research, development, and innovation of spatio-temporal data mining and AI, with a broad range of applications in smart cities. Prior to that, he obtained his PhD degree at School of Computing, National University of Singapore, supervised by Prof. [Roger Zimmermann](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/rogerz) and Prof. [David S. Rosenblum](https://cs.gmu.edu/~dsr/). He also worked closely with Dr. [Yu Zheng](http://urban-computing.com/yuzheng) and Dr. [Junbo Zhang](https://zhangjunbo.org/) from JD Technology. He published 90+ papers in refereed journals (e.g., TPAMI, AI, TKDE, TMC) and conferences (such as KDD, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, WWW, ECCV, IJCAI, AAAI, and MM). His publications collectively gathered 4,700 citations on Google Scholar, with h-index of 34 and i10-index of 61. Among them, three papers ([GeoMAN](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2018/0476.pdf), [ST-MetaNet](http://urban-computing.com/pdf/kdd_2019_camera_ready_ST_MetaNet.pdf) and [STMTMVL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ijcai16-Zheng-water-quality.pdf)) were selected as the most influential IJCAI/KDD papers according to PaperDigest, which indicates their significant impacts on both industry and academia. He also served as the Assosiate Editor of Neurocomputing (IF=6.0), and PC member (or reviewer) for prestigious conferences, including KDD, ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, WWW, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, IJCAI, AAAI, Ubicomp and SIGSPATIAL (outstanding PC). He was recognized as [Stanford/Elsevier Top 2% Scientists](https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/7) in 2024.

He was recognized as 1 out of 10 most innovative and impactful PhD students focusing on Data Science in Singapore by Singapore Data Science Consortium (SDSC) in 2020. His research interests mainly lie in
- **Spatio-temporal (ST) data mining & Urban computing**: ST representation learning, Urban/ST + LLMs, AI for social good (e.g., transportation, human mobility, environment, climate), physics-informed learning.
- **Time series analysis**: foundation models, forecasting, imputation, decomposition, anomaly detection.
- **Graph mining**: learning graph representations (e.g., directed graphs, temporal graphs), GNN pruning.
- **Multimodal learning**: urban multimodal fusion, vision-language pre-training, geo-localization.
